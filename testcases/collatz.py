# Example from https://medium.com/starkware/arithmetization-i-15c046390862
# A Collatz sequence starts with any positive integer n.
# If n is even, the next element is n/2. Otherwise, it is 3*n+1. 
# The Collatz conjecture says that the sequence always ends in 1
#
# Example with n = 52 
# 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
